Simple common data transfer objects

Data transfer object is an object that carries data between processes. 
The motivation for its use has to do with the fact that communication 
between processes is usually done resorting to remote interfaces (e.g. 
web services), where each call is an expensive operation. Because the 
majority of the cost of each call is related to the round-trip time 
between the client and the server, one way of reducing the number of 
calls is to use an object (the DTO) that aggregates the data that would 
have been transferred by the several calls, but that is served by one 
call only.

The difference between data transfer objects and business objects or data 
access objects is that a DTO does not have any behavior except for storage 
and retrieval of its own data (accessors and mutators). DTOs are simple 
objects that should not contain any business logic that would require testing.
